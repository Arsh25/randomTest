Automated testing for tabula rasa

Things tend to break unless they're run regularly, so we need to run tabula regularly.

Idea:
	Check out clean version of code
	Start clean superstar
	Build and flash tabula firmware
	Start backend
	Automate browser actions to configure backend
	Verify commands are making it
